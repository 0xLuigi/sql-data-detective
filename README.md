MetaMask vault data can often be found in .sqlite 👆 database files. <br>
You can open them with a standard text editor or by using a tool like EmEditor: https://www.emeditor.com or Notepad++<br>

However, sometimes the MetaMask vault data might be incomplete, and you'll need to open the database and find this information in the Object Data table, specifically within the BLOB data field.

<p>
Therefore, I created this simple application 👇 that can find BLOB data and convert it into a readable format with a single click.
